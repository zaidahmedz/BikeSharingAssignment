# Project Name
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## General Information
- This project aims to analyze the BoomBike bike-sharing dataset to develop a predictive model using linear regression. The objective is to predict the total number of bike rentals based on various features such as weather conditions, time of year, and other relevant factors. This model can help in understanding the key factors influencing bike rental demand and assist in optimizing bike availability and distribution.
- Bike-sharing systems have become a popular mode of transportation in urban areas due to their convenience and environmental benefits. However, the usage patterns of these systems can be highly variable, influenced by factors such as weather, time of day, and season. By leveraging historical data, we can build predictive models to forecast bike rental demand. This can help operators manage inventory, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency.
- The primary business problem this project addresses is the optimization of bike availability and distribution in a bike-sharing system. By accurately predicting the number of bike rentals, the company can ensure that there are enough bikes available to meet demand at different times and locations. This can reduce instances of bike shortages or surpluses, enhance user satisfaction, and improve the overall efficiency of the bike-sharing service.
- The dataset used for this project is the BoomBike bike-sharing dataset

## Conclusions
- Weather conditions significantly influence bike rental demand. Specifically, clear or partly cloudy weather (represented by lower weather situation values) tends to result in higher bike rentals, while adverse weather conditions (such as rain or snow) lead to a decrease in rentals. This insight can help the company plan for increased bike availability during favorable weather conditions.
- Seasonal patterns have a noticeable impact on bike rentals. The data indicates that bike rentals are higher during the spring and summer months compared to the fall and winter. This seasonal variation suggests that promotional efforts and resource allocation can be adjusted accordingly to maximize bike usage during peak seasons.
- The time of day and day of the week are crucial factors affecting bike rental demand. The analysis reveals that bike rentals peak during morning and evening rush hours on weekdays, indicating a strong demand for bikes for commuting purposes. Conversely, weekends show a more even distribution of rentals throughout the day, suggesting a different usage pattern primarily for leisure activities.
- The presence of holidays and working days also affects bike rental patterns. There is a noticeable drop in bike rentals on holidays compared to regular working days, which can be attributed to reduced commuter demand. Understanding this trend can help in planning bike maintenance and redistribution during periods of lower demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
